# LotteryPredictor
This was a little side project to analyse the frequency of the Euromillion Lottery numbers to try and generate a winning combination. 

It hasn't worked yet. 

There is a private repository that does the same in more depth for a uni project a couple of years ago. 

When Uni is over I'll release it. 

It also hasn't worked yet.
